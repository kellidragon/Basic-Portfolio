        <p class= "aboutMe">
                I feel that I am most fulfilled when working on creative projects.
                After studying film production in college I found myself working on
                various tv and film sets for major networks. During my time working in 
                production I was built by this persistent bug, the travel bug. I decided 
                if I was going to seriously travel it was going to be now or never. So, I 
                took a job in the Middle East and made traveling my main priority. For the next 
                three years I was fortunate enough to step foot on about 80 different countries. 
                I consider myself a curious person who loves challenges 
                 that require me to dabble into different things.
